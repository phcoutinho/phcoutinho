## Pedro Henrique Coutinho 

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher and a temporary lecturer at the Federal University of Minas Gerais.
My main topics of interest are convex and quasi-convex optimization methods for robust and nonlinear control and networked control systems.

My research program concentrates on the area of control systems. I am broadly interested in the study of robust and nonlinear control systems, usually in circumstances where interesting and relevant issues arise from sampled-data control implementations. More precisely, my main research topics include:

- Convex and quasi-convex methods for robust and nonlinear control: in this context, the idea is to represent uncertain, time-varying, and/or nonlinear dynamical systems by linear differential inclusions that allow obtaining convex or quasi-convex conditions for analysis and synthesis.

- Cyber-physical systems: by following the idea of the last topic, the interest is designing resource-aware controllers for the stabilization of networked control systems considering network-induced imperfections and the presence of malicious cyber-attacks affecting communication.
